### CI-CD & Publishing

This project uses GitHub Actions for automated tests and deployment. The `.github/workflows` folder comprise of three major workflows:
1. `deploy-mkdocs.yml` : It handles the automated deployment of the documentation site. It is triggered on every push to the main branch.
2. `release.yml`: It handles the release of the package to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/). It happens when a tag with `v*` is set and pushed to the main branch.
3. `tests.yml`: It runs on every pull requests and push to the main branch. It runs the test suites across major Python versions (3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11).
